    <h1>Mesos architecture</h1>
  </header>

  <article class="post-content">
  <p>In the following we provide you with a technical description of the Mesos Architecture.
The picture and its scheduling example are directly taken from the Apache Mesos Project Page.</p>

<div class='fig figcenter fighighlight'>

</div>

<p>The above figure shows the main components of Mesos. Mesos consists of a master daemon that manages slave daemons running on each cluster node, and mesos applications (also called frameworks) that run tasks on these slaves.</p>

<p>The master enables fine-grained sharing of resources (cpu, ram, …) across applications by making them resource offers. Each resource offer contains a list of . The master decides how many resources to offer to each framework according to a given organizational policy, such as fair sharing, or strict priority. To support a diverse set of policies, the master employs a modular architecture that makes it easy to add new allocation modules via a plugin mechanism.</p>

<p>A framework running on top of Mesos consists of two components: a scheduler that registers with the master to be offered resources, and an executor process that is launched on slave nodes to run the framework’s tasks (/documentation/latest/see the App/Framework development guide for more details about application schedulers and executors). While the master determines how many resources are offered to each framework, the frameworks&#39; schedulers select which of the offered resources to use. When a frameworks accepts offered resources, it passes to Mesos a description of the tasks it wants to run on them. In turn, Mesos launches the tasks on the corresponding slaves.</p>

<div class='fig figcenter fighighlight'>
  <img src='/assets/architecture-example.jpg'>
</div>

<p>Let’s walk through the events in the figure.</p>

<ol>
<li>Slave 1 reports to the master that it has 4 CPUs and 4 GB of memory free. </li>
<li>The master then invokes the allocation policy module, which tells it that framework 1 should be offered all available resources.</li>
<li>The master sends a resource offer describing what is available on slave 1 to framework 1.</li>
<li>The framework’s scheduler replies to the master with information about two tasks to run on the slave, using <2 CPUs, 1 GB RAM> for the first task, and <1 CPUs, 2 GB RAM> for the second task.</li>
<li>Finally, the master sends the tasks to the slave, which allocates appropriate resources to the framework’s executor, which in turn launches the two tasks (depicted with dotted-line borders in the figure). Because 1 CPU and 1 GB of RAM are still unallocated, the allocation module may now offer them to framework 2.</li>
</ol>

<p>In addition, this resource offer process repeats when tasks finish and new resources become free.</p>
