## TUM Lab Course
This is a Lab Course offered by the Technical University Munich in Winter 14/15 with 10 ECTS points.
It is the first of its kind and therefore we generate this guideline for future students who plans to take or are taking this lab course.
In this script, we focus on deeper understanding, try to give important hints and explain via code as much as possible.

## Objective 
The Objective of this course is to learn about newest technology in distributed data mining such as Hadoop and Spark and its
machine learning frameworks Mahout and MLLib in order to handle and mine massive datasets. 
Due to the novelty of the course, it is mainly self-guided and hence allows participants to tackle the objective in different approaches.
