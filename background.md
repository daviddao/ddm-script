## TUM Lab Course
This is a Lab Course offered by Technical University Munich in Winter 14/15 with 10 ECTS points.
It is the first of its kind and hence we think, it is very helpful to write down our experiences.

## Objective 
The Objective of this course is to learn about newest technology in distributed data mining such as Hadoop and Spark and its
machine learning frameworks Mahout and MLLib in order to handle and mine massive datasets. 
Due to the novelty of the course, it is mainly self-guided and hence allows participants to tackle the objective in different approaches.
